        <h1>Ye Henry Li</h1>
        <p>I am an expert statistician (data and machine learning scientist) with
                in-depth experience helping teams and organizations to make the best use of data.
                In my work, I dig through the technical complexities of data pipelines and computing systems,
                cross-organizational communications, and tools readily available on the market,
                to explain in plain English what is going well and what needs to be improved.
                If an organization wants to make an improvement to their data assets and product automation,
                I am here to help with the research and development work. I worked with teams in academic settings,
                big tech and startups to launch machine learning capabilities.
                I strive to make precise and valuable incremental changes
                as well as business direction-defining quantum leaps.</p>
