        <p>Hello and welcome to my website! üéâ üôå üòÉ</p>
        <p>I am a statistician and scientist with expertise in contemporary
            data technology through both academic
            training
            and professional experience. My career is defined by the pursuit of innovation and excellence. I have helped
            various organizations solve challenges in systems complexities using a wide range set of tools familiar to
            practitioners in data science, algorithmic research, engineering, and product management.</p>
        <p>I earned a double BA in
            Biochemistry and Statistics from the University of California, Berkeley. I also completed a PhD in
            Structural
            Biology (Biophysics) and a Master‚Äôs Degree in Public Policy at Stanford University.

<div class="section" id="education">
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <p>My academic journey started at the University of California, Berkeley, where I studied Statistics and
        Biochemistry. I performed undergraduate research on the mechanism of DNA replication in Prof. John Kuriyan‚Äôs
        lab with Dr. Brian Kelch. This period was instrumental in building my foundation in biochemical and
        biophysical methods for experimental design, project management and data collection; additionally, I honed
        my skills in applying computational biology methods to organize, process, analyze, and interpret the data to
        model complex biological systems.</p>

    <p>To further my passion for unraveling biological complexities, I pursued the intersection of
        biology and statistics at Stanford University, where I completed a PhD in Structural Biology (Biophysics). Under
        the
        guidance of renowned advisors like Prof. Wing Wong, Prof. Garry Nolan, and Prof. Michael Levitt, I completed
        my doctoral research on cellular states and biological systems. My work shed new light on dynamical gene
        networks, contributed to our understanding of the biochemical and genetic factors in bone development and
        aging, and pioneered new algorithms for high-dimensional single-cell datasets with statistical emphasis on
        data batch effects and cross-sample mapping of cell populations.</p>

    <p>In my postdoctoral work at the Stanford Blood Center with Prof. Ed Engleman, I developed and applied
        computational techniques on high-dimensional tissue images to understand the side effects of immunotherapy
        strategies.

    <h2>Professional History</h2>
    <p>As a long-time resident of Silicon Valley, I followed the fast-paced changes in the tech industry very
        closely. While laboratory-based academic research has given me the opportunity to discover, I have always
        been fascinated by the ability of tech industry professionals in solving business problems at scale by
        applying knowledge of statistical and machine learning. On top of that, I wanted to understand how to
        quickly launch reliable machine learning capabilities to put ‚Äòmagic‚Äô into the hands of users. This know-how
        should offer guidance on any innovative project in the future.</p>

    <p>I decided to join Uber Technologies, at the time a fast-moving, giant startup, to learn high-quality,
        industry-standard data science and engineering best practices from some of the most experienced
        professionals in the tech industry. At Uber, I optimized processes behind various business products as part
        of a small data science team. I developed and built Uber‚Äôs first statistical data anomaly detection service
        to scale the company‚Äôs data quality monitoring. In addition, I developed Uber‚Äôs data-driven business outage
        detection and mitigation framework. I also worked with the internal hardware and infrastructure teams to
        understand the company‚Äôs computing needs, hardware purchasing plans, and the transition of data storage from
        on-premise data centers to the cloud. In all, these infrastructure projects improved the company‚Äôs cost
        efficiency by >$50 million.</p>

    <p>After building Uber‚Äôs data quality monitoring service, I wanted to develop the same product for all
        companies. No software company at the time offered an enterprise tool for data monitoring‚Äìmost companies
        relied on building data monitoring in-house, which is very expensive. I joined Bigeye Data as the third
        employee and first data scientist to achieve the vision of a data observability enterprise software for all.
        In the last three years, I developed and built machine learning and AI automation in the Bigeye software.
        Bigeye is used by organizations in many industries, and past and present users come from many companies
        including Zoom, Instacart, Confluent, and the intelligence community in a partnership with In-Q-Tel.</p>

    <p>I will continue to use my deep expertise in statistics and the sciences to contribute to groundbreaking
        advancements. I am committed to making a significant impact in information technology, the biosciences, and
        policy through data-driven innovations.</p>
